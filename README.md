**Earthquake Visualization**

This project visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet and D3.js. It creates a map that plots earthquakes based on their longitude, latitude, magnitude, and depth.

**Features**

Dynamic Marker Size: The size of the markers on the map corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake. Larger earthquakes are represented by larger markers.
Color-Coded Depth: The depth of the earthquakes is indicated by the color of the markers. Deeper earthquakes are represented by darker colors.
Interactive Popups: Clicking on a marker displays a popup with additional information about the earthquake, including its magnitude, location, and depth.
Legend: A legend is provided on the map to help interpret the colors used for depth representation.
Usage
To use this project:

**Data Source**

The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. The dataset is updated regularly and provides information about earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher over the past month.

**Technologies Used**

Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

D3.js: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
